# Data Cleaning and Pre-processing Method:

â€¢	I began with data inspection to understand the structure and quality of the data from various platforms.
â€¢	I ensured all datasets had the same columns and then concatenated them into a single dataframe.
â€¢	I generated a detailed quality report displaying missing values, data types, and unique values.
â€¢	For data cleaning, I removed percentage signs and commas from certain columns and converted them to appropriate data types. I also defined and used functions to visualize the distribution of numeric columns and remove outliers.
# Handling Missing Values:
â€¢	I visualized missing values using a heatmap.
â€¢	For certain columns, I used conditional imputation based on categories, like filling missing Impressions based on the Network category.
â€¢	For other columns, I used mean and median imputation.
# Convert Data Types:
â€¢	I converted columns with percentage signs and commas to float data type.
â€¢	I also converted several columns to integer data type using the pd.to_numeric method.
# Remove Duplicate Entries:
â€¢	I checked for duplicates in the concatenated dataframe and confirmed there weren't any.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
â€¢	I grouped the data by certain columns to explore summarized data.
â€¢	I visualized the distribution of numeric columns and removed outliers.
â€¢	I examined unique values of certain columns and dropped columns that might not have been relevant for analysis.
Interpreting Visualizations:
â€¢	I visualized the distribution of numeric columns using the numeric_distribution_plot function. While the actual plots aren't displayed here, interpreting them would provide insights into the central tendency, spread, and shape of the data.
â€¢	Further steps I did include text cleaning, tokenizing, and removing stopwords. Additionally, I also handled more missing values and dropped columns that may not have been relevant.
Feature Engineering
Date-Time Features:
â€¢	I extracted several features from the Date column:
â€¢	Year: The year the post was made.
â€¢	Month: The month of the post.
â€¢	Day: The day of the month when the post was made.
â€¢	DayofWeek: The specific day of the week, which can help in analyzing patterns on particular days.
â€¢	Hour: The hour when the post was published, which can be crucial in analyzing user engagement based on different times of the day.
These features provide insights into temporal patterns, such as which days or hours lead to higher engagement.
Text-Based Features:
â€¢	From the content of the posts, I derived:
â€¢	Word_Count: The number of words in the post, which can give insights into the length of the post and its correlation with engagement.
â€¢	Char_Count: The number of characters in the post. Longer posts might engage users differently compared to shorter ones.
â€¢	Avg_Word_Length: Average length of the words in the post. This might correlate with the complexity or clarity of the content.
These features can help in understanding how the length and depth of the content influence user engagement.
Sentiment Scores:

â€¢	Based on the content, I calculated sentiment scores, which provide a measure of the sentiment or tone of the content:
â€¢	Polarity: Indicates how positive or negative the content is.
â€¢	Subjectivity: Indicates how subjective or objective the content is.
These scores were pivotal in analyzing how the sentiment of a post affects user engagement and overall sentiment distribution.
